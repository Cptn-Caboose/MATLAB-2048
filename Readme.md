# MATLAB-2048

Last year, I've created the popular game 2048 in MATLAB for an assignment. Today (2016-09-28), I've added a plot function to display the game as well.

#### Usage

To run the game, copy the game to your MATLAB folder. You'll have to run the file **Game2048.m**. If MATLAB says that it needs to change the working directory, click 'change directory.'

*What are the controls?*

The script allows three different control sets:

- LEFT: Press '1', 'a' or 'j'

- UP: Press '2', 'w' or 'i'

- RIGHT: Press '3', 'd' or 'l'

- DOWN: Press '4', 's' or 'k'
